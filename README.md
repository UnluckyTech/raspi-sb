# raspi-sb
RasPI Support Box!

Custom Bash Script for configuring a Raspberry Pi into a AIO-IOT Device. 
The idea is to incorporate various solutions for day to day problems for the general user without the headache of doing any sort of maintenance.

Everything will be ran in Docker to further delegate if any issues were to occure.
Below is a list of everything that will be installed and configured...

### Containers
- WatchTower (Automate Updates)
- PiHole (Block Ads/Malicious Sites)
- WireGuard (Utilize Benefits outside of home network)
